# About this app

This is a practice App to improve my skill in using React, Redux,
tailwind css, Firebase and react router. In this App, when you add an
item, it is transferred to the database (Firebase) through redux
actions. One of the challenges of this program was adding photos to
Firebase and then displaying them.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Tools:
- Redux (toolkit)
- Tailwind css
- Firebase 
- React router
